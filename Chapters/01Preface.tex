This project thesis is part of my studies in \textit{Engineering and ICT} at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) within the department of Robotics and Automation. It explores the creation of synthetic datasets for computer vision applications in maritime environments, specifically for autonomous harbor navigation. The work serves as a foundation for my upcoming masters thesis, which will further explore the topic in more depth.\\

\noindent I would like to thank my supervisor, Christian Holden, and co-supervisor, Tom Arne Pedersen, for their guidance and support throughout this project. I am also grateful to NTNU and DNV for providing the resources and context for this research.\\

\noindent Lastly, I would like to express my gratitude to my family and friends for their encouragement and support.\\
